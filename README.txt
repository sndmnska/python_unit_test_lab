Note to self (and anyone else reading this):

This repository contains the lab files for Week 4 of the Capstone labs (Winter 2024). 

Sorry about the lack of good git commit messages; I was struggling a little bit to wrap my head around unit testing.  
But, I think I understand it pretty well now at this point. 

Thanks,
